# TreeBHPython


This is a python implementation of the TreeBH algorithm outlined in the paper _Testing hypotheses on a tree: new error rates and controlling strategies_ by _Bogomolov e.t. al_. There is an R version of the this algorithm implemented by the authors found at this [repository]([https://link-url-here.org](https://github.com/cbpeterson/TreeBH)). This implementation is limited in that it requries a regular tree strutcure, our implementation works for any tree.
